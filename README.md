## Description ðŸ“”

In this project you can find .ipynb notebooks with code for training different models for collaborative filtering for recommendation system.  There are also reports of research work done during the assignment

## How to start ðŸš€

In order to run all the script you have to do the following procedure:

1.  Clone this git repo to your local machine

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lumiwarum/Movie-Recommender-System/tree/main
```

1. Create a new python virtual environment and activate it

```bash
python3 -m venv /env
source ./env/bin/activate
```

1. Install all the requrements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now youâ€™re ready to run all python script in this repo.

## Usage:

### Data processing:

1. [benchmark/prepare_data.py](https://github.com/Lumiwarum/Movie-Recommender-System/blob/main/benchmark/prepare_data.py) - downloads the dataset and extracts it into `data/raw` directory.

### Suggest films:

[benchmark/evaluate.py](https://github.com/Lumiwarum/Movie-Recommender-System/blob/main/benchmark/evaluate.py) - allows you to run the model for suggesting similar films to a film in the database.
